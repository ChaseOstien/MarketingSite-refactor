# Marketing Site Refactor

## Description

The goal of this project was to refactor the code base for the Horiseon Marketing Website to update it to a more accessible and readable format using semantic HTML and updating CSS structure. I replaced all div tags with the proper semantic elements, added descriptive alt attributes, changed the flow of the CSS rules to match that of the HTML doc and updated the title.
